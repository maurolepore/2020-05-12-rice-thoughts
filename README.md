# Programming with R

_A workshop based on the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) lesson [Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)_

## Help and Questions

Options to consider

* Use zoom (rise hand or thumbs up/down) to call a helper, maybe breakout to another room to allow remote control and debug.
* Do challenges in small break out groups so people can help each other and request helpers to join.
* Chat on gitter so that the questions are recorded and accessible to everyone. This may add complexity to the tools ecosystem.
